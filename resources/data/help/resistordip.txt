Set of resistors in a DIP configuration.

Property: (default value)

- Resistance: (100 Î©)

- Size: (8)
   Number of resistors.

- Pullup: (no)
   Configure resistor Dip as pullups connecting directly to a voltage source.
   If true, it will disconnect and hide pins at the top.

- Pullup Voltage: (5 V)
