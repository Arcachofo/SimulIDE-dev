Simple polarized capacitor.
Blinks if polarity is wrong.

Property: (default value)

- Capacitance: (10 µF)

- Resistance: (1 µΩ)

- Initial Voltage: (0 V)
   Voltage at simulation start (initial charge).

- Reactive Step: (0 ns)
   Set custom Reactive step for this component.
   This value overrides general Simulation Settings.
   0 to use value set in Simulation Settings.
