Timing:
- Propagation delay: (1 Gate)
   Total propagation delay in number of gates.
   Total delay = Gate delay x number of gates.

- Gate Delay: (10 ns)
   Time from input change to output change (1 gate).

- Rise Time: (3 ns)
   Time from 0 V to output high V.

- Fall Time: (4 ns)
   Time from output high V to 0 V.
