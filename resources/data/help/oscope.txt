Oscilloscope with 4 channels identified with different colors and frequency indicators for each channel.

There is one input pin per channel and one for reference voltage (last one besides Expand button).
You can connect inputs to wires or enter a tunnel name in the corresponding box.
Connecting the inputs and running the simulation you will see the wave forms.

Property: (default value)

- Screen Size X: (135)
   Screen width when not expanded.

- Screen Size Y: (135)
   Screen height when not expanded.

- Buffer Size: (600000)
   Number of samples retained in memory.

- Connect to ground: (true)
   Add an impedance to ground for each input.

- Impedance: (10 MÎ©)
   Value of impedance to ground If connected).
