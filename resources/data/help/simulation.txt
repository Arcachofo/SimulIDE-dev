Property: (default value)

- Simulation Speed %: (100%)
   Target simulation speed in percentage of real time. 

- Steps per Second: (1e6 us)
   Another way to set simulation speed.

NonLinear
- Max Iterations: (1e5)
   Number of maximum iteations for Non Linear simulation.
   0 for no limit.

Reactive
- Reactive Step (1 us)
   Update step for reactive components.
   Icrease: better simulation speed but less accuracy.

Logic Output Edges
- Slope Steps: (0)
   Number of steps for Output Pins rising/falling edges.
   0 for disabled.
