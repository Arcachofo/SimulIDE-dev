Property: (default value)

Main:
- Normally Closed: (no)
   State with relay not active.

- Double Throw: (no)
   Yes: 2 throws per pole.
   No: 1 throw per pole.

- Poles: (1)
   Number of poles controlled by this relay.


Electric:
- IOn: (20 mA)
   Minimun current that activates the relay.

- IOff: (10 mA)
   Minimun current that holds the relay active.

Coil:
- Inductance: (100 mH)
   Coil inductance.

- Resistance: (100 Î©)
   Coil resistance.

- Reactive Step: (0 s)
   Use a custom Reactive Step for this component.
   This value overrides general Simulation Setings.
   0 to use value set in Simulation Settings.
