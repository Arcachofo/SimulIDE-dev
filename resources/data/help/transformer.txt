Configurable transformer.

This transformer is highly configurable, allowing users to set up as many coils as needed on each side.
It's even possible to use coils exclusively on one side.

The term "Primary" refers to the left side, while "Secondary" refers to the right side.
However, any coil can function as the primary coil within the transformer.

Property: (default value)

- Coupling Coefficient: (0.99)

- Base Inductance: (1 H)
   Base inductance for all coils (refer to the coil descriptions below)

- Primary: (1)
   Description of coils in the left side (refer to the coil descriptions below).

- Secondary: (1)
   Description of coils at the right side (refer to the coil descriptions below).
