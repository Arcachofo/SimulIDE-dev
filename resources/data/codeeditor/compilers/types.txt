Compiler types:

For generic compilers, the field "type" defines certain characteristics ( for example type="asm01" ) .
The key is in the last 2 numeric digits: "01".
From left to right:
    
- First digit "0*" language level:
Value can be 0 or 1: 0 for asm, 1 for high level
    
- Second digit "*1" lst file type:
Value can be from 0 to 3:
    Bit0: use ":" ?
        0 doesn't use ":" (gpasm ).
        1 uses ":" (avra, gavrasm)
    
    Bit1: position of flash address (0 or 1)
